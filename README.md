# Retrofit2-RestApiDemo
This is a sample to make an http request using retrofit2 and display it on a recyclerview. If the device is offline, it is able to display the images and data from sqlite database. Used libraries: Picasso, retrofit, Google gson and others. If you are happy with the sample follow me on github.
